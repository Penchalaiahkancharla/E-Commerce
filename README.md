I developed a fully responsive real-time E-Commerce website with dynamic product listing, cart management, and secure checkout functionality. The application integrates API-based data handling, real-time updates, and persistent storage using LocalStorage. It features advanced filtering, authentication flow, and optimized UI/UX design. This project demonstrates strong proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with real-world application architecture.
